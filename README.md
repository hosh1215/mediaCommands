# mediaCommands

Using Auto Hot Key, this script adds some useful functions to my desktop experience.

Features:
  - Mail multimedia key --> reassigned to open Discord
  - Music multimedia key --> reassigned to open Spotify
  - both of these shortcuts can be reactivated to open or minimize the corresponding app
  - Files multimedia key --> opens up IDLE for quick python scripting
  - Windows + C --> opens Google Chrome in Incognito mode
  - Alt + ScrollUp/Down --> increase/decrease volume
  - Alt + Thumb Buttons --> Skip/Previous Song

For the commands that launches specific apps, replace the file path with the path of the file you want to launch.

For the hotkey combinations, its best to look up the AHK documentation to find what you want.
In terms of the Virtual Key assignments (vk##), I used the keycode.ahk script to get the value of the keypress.

I also added a shortcut to this file to my startup folder so that it automatically gets launched everytime I start my machine.
This script is something you probably want running all of the time in the background so I recommend doing so too.
